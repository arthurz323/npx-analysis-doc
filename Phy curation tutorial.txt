# Phy curation tutorial notes

## Terminology:
    peak channel: the channel that has the highest  highlighted in blue in ClusterView



Amplitude View:
    1. x-axis - time; y-axis - amplitude (scaling factor)

    2. the amplitude is NOT in mV, but the amplitude in the unit of the amplitude scaling factor, relative to the shape of the waveform; also noted in the ClusterView "amplitude"

    3. expect the neuron has a Gaussian distribution, indicating that there are actual spikes; if the distribution is cut-off (not complete Gaussian), then there are spikes missing, not registered by npx

    4. grey shows peaks from all other units that picked up by the peak channel



Waveform View:
    1. x-aixs - time; y-axis - amplitude (mV)
    
    2. gain model selection

    3. peak channel is centred



Correlogram view:
    1. x-axis - time (ms); y-axis - firing rate (Hz)
    
    2. Horizontal line: the baseline firing rate. 
    
    3. Vertical lines (2ms): the "refractory period"; change it with the view menu or with the :cr snippet.

    4. the central peak is artificially removed to avoid artefacts. 
    
    5. Decrease the bin size (e.g. to 0.1 ms) if you need to visualize fine temporal structure.



Feature View:
    1. principal component projections of each cluster
    
    2. used to make decision on merge or not
    
    3. grey: principal component projections of other spikes on the current channel (not from the selected unit) 



Trace view:
    1. shows the raw data traces across all channels, with spikes from the selected clusters as well. 
    
    2. You can also choose to show spikes from all clusters, not just selected clusters.



Cluster Scatter View:
    1. x-axis - width of probe; y-axis - depth of probe
    
    2. size of the dot shows ...?




General:
  1.after "save," there'll be a .tsv which shows a summary of the label of clusters (noise, mua, or good).
  
  2. do NOT upgrade label, i.e., no mua to good
  
  3. noise/artefact: has same waveform across channels



Current issue with running phy on aberlour:
    1. no Feature View
    
    2. my laptop is too SLOWWWW
    
    3.
